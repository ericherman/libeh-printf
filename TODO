libeh-printf TODO

* the linux specific code is included in the build... I suspect there is an
  autotools way to only include it if it if we are building on linux

* eh_printf() does not support %f very well, need to add zero padding and
  decimal place specification

* the functions "double ceil(double x)" and "double log10(double x)" require
  the "#include <math.h>" .... would be nice to break this requirement
