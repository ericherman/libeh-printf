libeh-printf TODO

* currently the private header is installed in $PREFIX/include but it should
  only be used at compile time

* the linux specific code is included in the build... I suspect there is an
  autotools way to only include it if it if we are building on linux

* eh_printf() does not support %f ... maybe it should?
