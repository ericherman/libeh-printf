eh-printf - A version of sprintf for embedded applications
Copyright (C) 2016, 2019 Eric Herman

I discovered that adding the normal glibc sprintf to my embedded
projects was resulting in a firmware which was too large. This
respository is a sandbox for playing with the idea of re-implementing
sprintf from scratch in hopes that I will have fun, learn a few things,
and maybe even have a useful (if incomplete and inefficient) version of
sprintf which will have a smaller firmware footprint. We shall see.
